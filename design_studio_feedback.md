Design Studio Feedback

After exchanging feedback for the design studio we were able to pinpoint a couple suggestions from the other team in regards to improving or adding to our visualization. Their only three concerns were data filtering, mapping the users own likes, and color usage. Data filtering could prove to be very usful as an additional optional feature and we may make plans to include this idea into future implementations. Mapping the users own likes seemed unnecessary because we should all know what we like, but it could be interesting to collect this data and create comparison charts or infographics. In regards to color, effective color usage is crucial to an engaging and well-implemented visualization and they suggested that we map the gender of a friend to a specific color (which we have tested in a later implementation of bubbles.html) And we feel that this defitely creates an easy legend for friends, and at a later date we will definitely work out all of our color choices/mappings via external css files. As a whole, their feedback was both friendly and useful considering that they told us what we implemented well, and where we could improve things.
